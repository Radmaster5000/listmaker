# listmaker

This is a short script to run through my iTunes playlists and change the paths of the tracks, creating identical playlists that will work on a different MP3 player.


It works but runs into issues with playlists that have spaces in their titles. Due to the risk of breaking what I have so far, I've created another branch to work on renaming files that contain spaces.

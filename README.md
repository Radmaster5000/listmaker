# listmaker

This is a short script to run through my iTunes playlists and change the paths of the tracks, creating identical playlists that will work on a different MP3 player.

It ran into an issue with playlists that have spaces in their names, so the first part of the program replaces spaces with underscores.


**************


HOW TO USE:

* Save iTunes playlists into iTunesPlaylists file on desktop. 
	
* Navigate to listMaker folder

USAGE: bash textify.sh

* Sony Walkman friendly playlist will be created in the WalkmanPlaylists folder on desktop

* Drop new playlist into MUSIC folder on Walkman
